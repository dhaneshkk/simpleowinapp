Simple Owin App
===============

How to play:
---
 - Donwload and build [Flux](https://github.com/markrendle/Flux).
 - Build this sample and copy the resulting binary ``SimpleOwinApp.dll`` in the same directory of ``Flux.exe``.
 - Point your browser to ``http://localhost:3333/``.

Notes:
---
This sample is derived from a Mark Rendle (author of Flux and Fix) one, see [here](https://github.com/markrendle/Fix/tree/master/Print). I've created it only to understand better [Owin](http://owin.org/spec/owin-1.0.0.html) specification, isolating the bare essentials in a simple project.
